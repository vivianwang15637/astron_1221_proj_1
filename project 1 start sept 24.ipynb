    "Astronomy 1221 - Project 1: Python & AI Integration\n",
    "Due: Week 6 | Weight: 20% of total grade\n",
    "PROJECT OVERVIEW\n",
    "Project 1 is designed to apply Python programming skills and AI tools learned in Weeks\n",
    "1-4 to create a practical astronomical application. Projects can range from simple data\n",
    "visualization tools using Week 1-3 material to more advanced LLM-integrated systems\n",
    "incorporating Week 4 content. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in Python\n",
    "programming while exploring how modern AI tools can enhance astronomical\n",
    "computing workflows. We encourage people to do LLM-related projects (Week 4), but if\n",
    "you are still warming up to coding, projects without LLMs are fine—though they should\n",
    "be more elaborate using the basic tools.\n",
    "Key Philosophy: Whether you choose one of our suggested projects or design your\n",
    "own, the goal is to create robust, maintainable code that demonstrates your\n",
    "understanding of fundamental programming concepts, not just your ability to import\n",
    "solutions. Each project should result in a complete system that could actually be useful,\n",
    "not just a proof of concept.\n",
    "TEAM FORMATION & TIMELINE\n",
    "● Teams: Work in pairs (one group of three if needed)\n",
    "● Partner Selection: Self-assign on Carmen by Friday, Week 4, 11:59pm (09/19)\n",
    "● Project Proposal: Submit a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project idea\n",
    "by Friday, Week 4, 11:59pm (09/19). Feedback will be provided by Sunday 09/21\n",
    "evening.\n",
    "● Final Report Submission: Upload completed project by Friday, Week 6,\n",
    "11:59pm (10/03)\n",
    "● Presentations: Week 6 during class (10 minutes per group). Time and schedule\n",
    "will be randomized with np.random.uniform()\n",
    "PROJECT REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "Technical Specifications\n",
    "● Core Requirement: Must be Python-based and relate to astronomy (broadly\n",
    "defined). No astronomy knowledge needed—many amateur astronomer type\n",
    "questions work well.\n",
    "● Scope: Should demonstrate mastery of concepts from Weeks 1-4\n",
    "● Code Foundation: The bulk of the project must rely on concepts and tools we\n",
    "learned in class, but you are certainly encouraged to go beyond (not restricted to\n",
    "Page 1 of 5\n",
    "only what we taught). Significant deviation from the topics we cover will incur\n",
    "penalty up to 10 points out of the 20 points.\n",
    "Programming Standards\n",
    "All projects should demonstrate good programming practices learned in Weeks 1-4,\n",
    "including:\n",

    "● Documentation: Clear docstrings and comments throughout\n",
    "Implementation Guidelines\n",
    "While you can use external packages for specialized tasks (particularly LLM APIs), you\n",
    "should build core functionality from scratch when possible:\n",
    "● Implement your own word counting rather than using a text analysis library\n",
    "● Write your own game logic rather than using a game engine\n",
    "● Create your own data structures rather than importing specialized ones\n",
    "● Implement your own algorithms for counting, sorting, searching, and game\n",
    "mechanics\n",
    "Note: Using NumPy, Matplotlib, and LLM APIs as taught in class is encouraged. Avoid\n",
    "importing specialized libraries that would replace core programming logic.\n",
    "Deliverables\n",
    "Single Jupyter Notebook containing:\n",
    "● Clear markdown sections explaining your project goals and methodology\n",

    "● Dependencies: Include !pip install or !conda install commands for any extra\n",
    "packages\n",
    "Page 2 of 5\n",
    "Note: This is deliberately open-ended so you can use your imagination, but the\n",
    "notebook must be easily readable end-to-end by your peers. Think of this as a\n",
    "publication piece you could put online for people to read.\n",
    "GitHub Bonus: While not required, we encourage uploading your project to GitHub\n",
    "(see Week 5) and adding the link to your notebook. Bonus 0.5 point for doing this.\n",

    "● GitHub repository creation (0.5 points)\n",
    "● Exceptional creativity or technical depth\n",
    "PROJECT SUGGESTIONS\n",
    "We provide 15 detailed project suggestions in the accompanying guidelines document,\n",

    "Overview: This notebook creates vacation brochures for 5 destinations across the Universe based on estimated flight distance & time from Earth, temperature, and atmosphere. We will have a list of 30 possible stars and planets you can visit while utilizing LLM API calls to generate 3 activites with date, time, and a 2 sentence brief description. Each brocherure contains the destination name, description of destination that is stored as an attribute of the SpaceDestination class, specs (distance, travel time, etc), and a cheap and expensive version of activities as well as a cost estimate."

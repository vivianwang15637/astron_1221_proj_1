    "## Introduction:  Project 11\n",
    "This notebook creates vacation brochures for 3 destinations across the Universe based on estimated flight distance & time from Earth, temperature, and atmosphere. We will have a list of 8 possible stars and planets you can visit while utilizing LLM API calls to generate 2 activites with date, time, and a 2 sentence brief description. Each brocherure contains the destination name, description of destination that is stored as an attribute of the SpaceDestination class, specs (distance, travel time, etc), and a cheap and expensive version of activities as well as a cost estimate.\n"
